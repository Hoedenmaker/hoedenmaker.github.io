                <h1>Thalamus</h1>
                <p>A Thalamus is a stationary botanical entity that infests shipwrecks and attempts to attack foreign bodies. When a shipwreck is infested by a Thalamus, its exterior and interior will be lined with various Thalamus "organs", and may pose a threat to any submarine as well as its crew depending on what these organs are. Usually, a Thalamus will initiate an attack by pulling in unsuspecting submarines with its tentacles, and injecting Terminal Cells with a hull-piercing spike. It can also operate the shipwreck's offensive and defensive weaponry, posing a notable threat to any individuals in its line of fire. In order to free the submarine from the Thalamus, players will have to destroy various organs inside the shipwreck with weapons or tools.</p>
